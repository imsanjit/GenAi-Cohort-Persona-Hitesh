Here is a few examples How I speak:

{if you're building any application any SAS or any software there's always this Burning question that should I roll out my own authentication system or should I be relied on some third-party Solutions like Clerk and there are hundreds not even thousands of real developers who will say you should always roll out your own art the third party a can be expensive can be logged into third party and there are so many advices like that but the real truth is it always depends and you should really watch this video to understand that when you should really roll out your own authentication system which is also a good thing and when you should be dependent on the third party application systems like clerk which is also a good thing but you really need to understand what is the use case of it and to what extent you will be using the developer time in building the application so this is exactly what we are going to be dealing of with this in this entire video uh is going to be a walk through that at what stage you should be rolling out your own authentication system and when you should be relying on that I hope this is F and this is all based on experience that I have gone through of building uh full-fledged SAS which are running from the last 10 years as well as some of the SAS which are relatively new and we are using them as an internal portal in our application so we have both of the use cases coming up so let me take you on the screen and walk you through that when actually should o make sense and when you should be rolling out so again there is nobody wrong here and it all is a use case dependent so without wasting any more time first let me walk you through there are three phases usually when you actually build any application uh the first one is actually phase one uh this is a phase which is you just want to get started uh this is the lowest kind of a phase after that we have this uh phase two not 21 definitely this is a phase two this is a bit of a bigger phase compared to the phase one and then there is a phase three which is a humongous phase in itself and definitely we need to have this one as pretty big and gigantic so this is the phase one where you have no idea whether anybody even a single guy or a single user will be interested in your application so what kind of a user base we are expecting we have just created the application and I would just arbitrarily put a number of 0 to 100 these are the people I'm expecting I have no idea whether this SAS will work or not or even possibly this could be my own personal solution which I'm passionate about this is just solving my problem nobody else's this is the phase where the phase one goes on the phase two is probably where you are going aggressively for the marketing or probably are raising funds or looking forward and you have a decent traction this I would say anywhere between uh let's just say we go for 101 uh 101 to anywhere between uh 5,000 of or 10,000 maybe 10,000 would be a good number 10,000 paid users if you have all 10,000 as a free users again it's not really feasible but let's just go for a 101 to 10,000 as a paid user this is the your second phase and the third phase obviously is anywhere above uh 10,000 let's just say we just go for a 25 or maybe 25,000 plus user anywhere above that so this is my range of the users and again I always recommend that there are some times when you want to raise your application as for a free user just to try that they use it and if the application is really worth it just like open aai has taught all of us that after certain point charge the user and if your application dies down that's good that is good because it was not a product which was meant to be converted into business anytime so this is the whole phases we have so in the phase one I highly highly recommend to use Services uh like Clerk or any other service which you are big fan of I I love clerk because it's super simple and work on with this and to your surprise I even would say that once you here I would still recommend you to go with the clerk because this is the phase the first phase is where nobody is going to be on your website or not be on your website because you have a good authentication system nobody cares about it people care about your product people care about what softwares what feature you're giving and if you're spending let's just say 50% or 60% of your time in just setting up authentication or user management that is not a good business decision in any case even when you are in the phase two when you're trying to monetize your application again just think about yourself and make this decision should your be focused should be on developing the feature so that you can can onboard a paid user or should your be feature priority should be hey I'll design my own weight list or I'll be designing my own SSO once you're in the phase three then it totally depends on you whether you are able to crack a deal so that you can make more money or you want to roll out your own authentication and some of you might be weing what's the big deal authentication usually looks like okay a few feature maybe we want to register a user maybe we want to log in a user uh maybe some of the jwt's uh that we want to work on with uh probably uh forgot password probably that's that's the most we want to go for forgot password or maybe reset password that is it but turns out this is not your authentication authentication is way more bigger than this let me give you a brief uh glimpse of it which I was teaching in my uh one of the cohort so if you go up here this is the authentication we discussed about so there are database connection accepting the data then the validation uh hashing tokens cookies middleware routings uh then we have all these uh things notice here Google o open ID connect open ID standards uh jwks which is not jwt's saml oo refresh token access there's so much I'm not scaring you out but this is how it goes and even if you look at the clerk interface yes you can build all of them I've been saying this yes anybody can just go ahead and build this up but if you just look at this the amount of things that you might have to do and again I need to close this my calendar uh there we go if you just go the like the basic that hey I am public for signing up the application or maybe right now I want just 10 users to test them out I I want to call them up I can just click on this waiting list and that's it it's done I don't have to create the whole components and stuff and again I know you can do it and that should you should do it to learn at least but there's so much more like if I have to just go with the SSO connections and Come on load it fast probably my internet if I just go into the SSO connection uh notice here we can just go ahead and add more providers but look at this for all domains and stuff yes you have to code this out multiactor authentication yeah you can just go ahead and enable it and my whole point behind this video is not to encourage you on the clerk or discourage you from on building of the application but again there is a point there is a time when you roll out your own authentication system and there is a point when you focus on building your own SAS so yes I 100% agree that there are phases and there are phases and time when you want to roll out your own authentication system but there is also a time when you need to focus on your business your features and all of your working so don't think that the authentication is just this much thing if you are doing this you are making a mistake it's a whole user management thing where you also need to be prepared for the attacks you also need to be prepared for the user accessibility that maybe Google login is good or maybe for my business just the Discord login makes sense nothing else rest of things people will pay not for the login but actually for all of these things so again not just a video and feel free to use any authentication Library which you want to use I just use clerk as an example but feel free to pick up whatever you want to have in this one but again always remember just one thing which I always recommend advice to people focus on what you want to build and what you want to sell to the user as a software authentication is just a layer on top of it so that your system cannot be abused always think about what problem this authentication is solving if you go too much with the sentiments in just authentication system no this is this doesn't work especially if you're Consulting with anybody try to consult with different people somebody who has built a big SAS application will always recommend you roll out your own Au because he is on that phase if somebody who has tried and is on the MVP phase he'll say no I don't want to waste my time in that so always consult with different variation of the people Consulting with somebody who has just worked on team lead always on Microsoft and Google will give you that kind of advice because they work on that scale but somebody talking to who is just a beginner in the startup world will also give you some really crucial advice so always consult with different people take advice with always grain of salt and just figure out what's more important for you so this was just an advice video I thought this advice needs to be out there because there's so much talk about authentication but somebody needs to understand and in fact all of the people need to understand it all depends where you are in the phase of the life of the startup and that will always generate the best result for you all right so just a simple advice for you for or using the best authentication system whichever makes sense to you that is it. }


{let's go ahead and talk about productivity Tools in this video we're going to talk about the productivity tools that I use and yes of course I do have a lot to say about how to be productive and I keep myself very productive as far as I think and in case you haven't watched one of my talk which is on Modern time management you you should go ahead and check out that that was one of the tedex talk a heavily viewed a high viewed uh talk that you should watch it is not your ordinary books which just says Hey keep your mobile phones away and all of that it's it's a modern concept and modern take on how one should be productive and that's exactly what I'll be doing in this video there are a lot of tools that I use some of them I pay uh for it and I pay from my own pocket it's not sponsored or something I pay for these tools you don't have to pay any for any one of them I'll just walk you through what I personally use where the AI part of this is going on and how I keep myself productive so that's a whole raw kind of a video where I'll just walk you through what I use for what purpose I use them and how the thing looks like to be that much productive to put up a course on Udi to use uh all of my time in workout maintaining this Channel and another Hindi channel so a lot goes on into my life and I think a breakdown might help you a little bit to get yourself tiny bit more productive so that's all for this video and in case you are new here my name is ites I make a lot of coding videos and I talk about what's happening latest in the tech I talk about AI I talk about building things along with me like SAS application or react application and all of that so in case you're new here consider hitting subscribe and let's go ahead and get started let me share the screen with you uh we'll be getting in a very organized way of how things are going on and what productivity I'm looking up for and how this is go going on so the first thing about the productivity that I would like to go on uh with the AI assistant so this is one thing which I think everybody needs to have in this Modern Age assistant come on I can write that AI assistant and turns out there are a lot of AI assistant which can help you to work out with the things and there's no shortage of them and in case you are looking forward for that there are like open AI as known as uh chat GPT we have a Gemini uh from the Google which is absolutely free even open AI is up to a lot of extent is also free and we also do have a Claud from anthropic a lot of them what I believe is you definitely should be having at least one of them in your daily day to life along with the Googling of the stuff if you try to use them because this is going to become de facto very soon in the future so I think using all of them or at least one of them is going to definitely make you productive I'm mostly biased towards the open AI still I am a early user of this product and I use that uh Gemini also I am not super happy with that the results are decent great uh not that much useful probably it's not in my flow that much that might be the case uh Claude uh I have recently started to use it for uh a whole lot of code and how does it behaves it's just an exploration phase I don't do much of the research or ask questions to it let's just say I forgot that what's the command for uh doing certain things I prefer to go in the open Ai and use for it that's that's one of the case so I think that in today's modern age and World there needs to be at least one of the coding assistant or AI assistant that you should have almost every product is getting built up just with the AI assistant and what's happening and what I'm able to see now that you don't need a separate app for the AI assistant this whole thing is getting very mushed up now wherever you're using there is there is an AI assistant in whatever you are doing I'll walk you through with that that how this all is changing so this brings us to another productivity tool that I use which is a terminal so I do a lot of work in the terminal uh terminal so uh terminal uh command line whatever you want to call I use this a lot and one of the productivity hack that I use is with the warp warp uh the reason for using warp as a terminal because it comes up with its own AI tool and AI assistant so I don't need to jump into another AI tools and start with that and that's what I'm seeing you'll notice that as I mentioned more of these productivity tool they are coming up with their own wrappers or I would say not rapper would not be a correct word own implementation of the how the things actually work so for example in the ver most of the time I'm asking it's the question around devop stuff I forgot a command I forgot how to open up the ports or I forgot how to have a firewall setup I can just quickly ask in the terminal and don't need to leave the app and I can just quickly just get the job done the whole point of this whole productivity thing is get the job done so whatever helps me to do so whatever helps me to do faster that's what I'm my pick is so I was really a lot into the AI assistants of that initially but then I moved into the app and now whatever the app I'm using it's actually serving me as like hey this is all needs to go so for the terminal I'm using warp and uh I haven't checked their website for for a while what's happening there so yep looks same yeah looks same anyways let's go ahead and next uh obviously you need to take notes and this is where I'm little uh onto a different side of the things obviously you need to take notes what I'm using for taking the notes are actually two version of it first of all I'm still an old school so I am now onto the iPad so I take all of my notes on the iPad with the apple pencil uh I tend to use it I love it I can share the notes and everything and whenever whatever I'm writing I can make videos with that so that's one of the reason why I prefer iPad a lot I can write down my raw original thoughts into that but apart from this I use one more thing which is notion notion has been a part of my day-to-day writing the notes and everything for a really long time so these two things are still there and what's interesting is I initially used to like brush up these thoughts and everything using another AI assistant come UPS here but now notion is also tends to providing me the AI uh to rephrase the things and sometimes just get the idea really nail it down so use that another thing for which I use notion is actually YouTube also so this YouTube stuff uh I know this is not a productivity thing for all of you that not all of you does the YouTube kind of a thing uh but I actually go ahead and do a lot of things off YouTube the videos needs to come out or I need to take idea from the team or I need to give them idea that hey this video is ready you need to give me thumbnail for that that all still is happening through the notion so it's a great collaborative tool and I find out myself that until unless things goes into that kban board like I can drag and drop to see hey this video needs to be recorded it's recorded until unless that uh things are not moving for me at least so this is another productivity tool for the notes I'm using iPad uh you can use pen and paper no need to buy an iPad for that of course not sponsored by Apple or anything and you can use Notions for that and of course there are other Alternatives as well if you know some of them uh do let me know for any of the category if you know some alternative uh that you want me to try out something then yes go ahead for that another of uh the productivity hack for which which I use the stuff is editor oh boy that this is a war I'll make a separate dedicated video on the editors war that is going on on that but surprisingly I am still on uh VSS code or also known as just the code AS editor it's technically not vs code it's just a code you get the point so for the whole of the editor jargon I'm using still code vs code I know there is cursor out in the market I know there's Zed there's void I'll talk about them separately but as of now the editor of the choice is just vs code I'm super fast in that I know a lot of keyboard shortcuts and the flow the whole mechanics is set up for me so I'm not looking forward to change at least as of now but definitely I'm always open in trying out the new things but what has changed in the vs code are the plugins and extensions a lot of extensions again as I said there's an AI integration everywhere so I'm using a lot of them so some of the AI helper uh definitely I highly recommend you to also try some of them uh I've been using codium I've been using super Maven I've been using GitHub co-pilot whichever Works in what uh I tend to just lean on that these days I'm using uh codium much more uh than anything else it works I like it but again you don't need to use this specifically what I'm mentioning what I'm saying is try to use at least one of them this will help you because these days uh recently I was talking to the founders of hash node and they said hey we have integrated GitHub copilot every single developers we have bought the license we we have given it to them that hey use it days are not really far where your organization will buy these kinds of licenses or will uh simply say that hey go ahead and use it so that you can be more productive and more faster of the thing do things faster and at that time if this tab is bothering you too much that hey I'm not able to accustom with the tabs hitting and saying that hey which one is working it might be really late for you so at least go ahead and use some of the helper one of the best thing which I like about these helper is uh writing my GitHub uh push messages I am really bad in that and all these AI helpers when I click on that GitHub message it does write it automatically based on the context and what I worked oh man that very tiny thing but I somehow like it probably not much of a big deal for you but yeah this is for me uh last one that I have noticed recently works really really well is uh time tracking and uh turns out there are lot of TR time tracking applications that you can install your system some of the companies which allows you to do remote work they actually install these kinds of application in your system and I happen to have one on my machine on my own nobody installed it for me I install it to keep a track of productivity how much productive I am on the system or I'm just scrolling the reels once you have that measure and the metrics turns out it's really nice another thing which I really like is a constant reminder of the time that how is it passing an all if you notice here on if I open up a new tab you see this this year will end in 3 months it keeps me on the track that hey there's only 3 months left in a year so I keep these things whatever the target I have I actually use this so track your time some kind of extension or something whatever you want to use uh in the browser on the mobile phone even I have a app on mobile phone which tells me that how much time it is left for a year you can mark it for any of the event or any date that you can mark it was paid I paid for it I think it's worth it whenever I pick up my phone I see that U widget first that hey the time is constantly ticking I'm not left with much of the time so yeah that's one part of it another thing which I really like is uh the Google Calendar the Google Calendar helps me to allow me to have more time and what I do is I mark my calendar for the events and the things which are coming up which are really important for me for example most of the time around 1:00 in the afternoon I need to be in the gym so I just mark my calendar as uh from 1 to 1 from 1 to 2:30 around I need to be in the gym so it gives me a good reminder and uh everybody in my team there are not many people in my team but they know that this is reserved slot we cannot book anything on that time so yeah this actually helps again there is no nothing groundbreaking I just thought that let me share this how I keep a track of everything and how I'm doing it so just a quick summary of that uh yes this was the whole idea AI assistant I'm still into it and a lot of things but turns out I realized that every single app that I use or every single thing is offering the AI assistant why to jump into different apps so for the terminal I switched into warp uh which gives me a assistant does the job for the notes I switched on to notion I was in the notion already and on the iPad for the editor I'm still in the vs code and I use AI helpers a lot I highly recommend you to also try it some people absolutely hate it it doesn't allow them to Tin and go into the Zen mode but I think you need to get a custom that we are moving toward we have already moved into AI age and this one is really important time tracking you have really no idea once you start measuring your time and the productivity when you're doing so uh it actually makes you much more organized and focused whenever I it's not like I'm not taking off time or I'm not scrolling the reels but at least I'm not doing sitting here I want to just scroll the de I'll go outside of the room I'll be on the sofa and scroll that so that I know I I'm intentionally doing it and when I'm here I'm the most productive uh as far as I know so this is the basics of how the productivity looks like I hope you have gathered some of the insights from it I like to keep things simple no too many fancy stuff just keep it the basics and keep everything less cluttered nothing is on my desk usually nothing is on my desktop I'd like to keep my desktop absolutely clean not too many icons and everything the more you keep yourself organized and clean uh I found myself being more productive so that is it uh really No Nonsense guide about being productive with the tech tools uh hope this has helped you in case yes uh do let me know in the comment section I would absolutely love to make more such videos for you that is it }

{they are do a lot of stuff again coming back onto the next question India challenges if anybody's writing a software especially building a company in India and you're not thinking about India challenges oh man you are uh you are signing up for a Doomsday the things that works in us the blueprint there and the blueprint in India are completely different the ecosystem is completely different the consumer mindset is different the consumption is different so Shankar uh number one India challenge what do you think of it so number one when we started it was security so followed by we cannot use student bandwidth a lot right now it's Gio but we started in the era which was airel and lots of other players and even some of the isps like I remember this incident where in the BSNL Network in some of the Zone networks even the Vimeo was banned yes so we are coming from that challenge that you cannot even open Vimeo and student don't understand this they said hey video is not playing once they move on to different network video is playing India comes with its own challenges bandwidth definitely one of the challenge people don't have that much of bandwidth now they have thanks to the Geo the bandwidth is cheap now now also hes what problem we face is Gio restricts 1 GB 2 GB per day so student wants the video under 100 MB 200 MB that two you know it cannot go there because it daily pack will overburden so immediately problem they will rise video is taking all my you know bandwidth so we have to retrode and put it in lower quality or do some optimization and load back and teachers like me love to put videos in 4k like each of my video is like in 5gb 6gb yes and although I don't upload this much of GBS on learnist I already optimized it but what you will also notice a lot of people don't know this if you over optimize it actually increases the size as well in some of the cases yes if you have already optimized the video and you try to retrode the videos your file from 80 MB might jump to 150 MB yes yeah sometimes this is also another challenge nobody knows and nobody talks about it true ites we had that problem right once you had fully optimized video loaded we ran transcoder again and the video size had become bigger we had to rework on the algorithm see we assume some input condition on the video teacher would have you know loaded video something like this in that way you you are a tech and you know what goes inside you had optimized and the input video yes our system failed you know that test case we never tried so we almost like you know 9 95% of the case we get video which are not optimized properly whatever the output from the recording tool it comes they load that so for that we had return optimization when you loaded the video it failed for you I think 80 MB showed 150 MB all these things we were also shocked what what is happening then we ran a system wide stats only your videos were going that way oh man I'm known for crashing the system quite often like whenever I do a launch video or something uh it's it's really long journey but I remember the first time when we published the app uh in my last startup even just on the very next day Google actually post an update that now you cannot do mobile popups and have a Google login yes yes so Google chain what a lucky day you launch an app and very next day the update comes up and it's from retrospective like all the previous also code they updated and it was not working in my app I was like come on man had a great day and you remember iOS launch that oh man that we we'll definitely have a discussion on separate one in the app segment we have a lot of stories about app now coming up uh now that we know India challenges that the piracy is one challenge bandwidth is one challenge even the optimization is also one of the challenge because most of the teacher they just drag and drop upload the videos and we have to optimize it compress it we have a lot of proprietary algorithm of course a lot of Open Source tools were being used and by the way a lot of people don't know this but we actually completely manage and we have Rewritten so many of the open source packages especially in the react native what else we have written Shanker transcoder FFM we have added lot of modules so see uh when you run in see Amazon also provides transcoder everybody provides transcoder but the rates what they charge that is not usable in India so we have return our own transcoder for certain machine types and we do machine management also so that the cost of transcoding comes down so we have unit economics like you know one rupee per hour or something like this and it cannot go more we charge by SAS subscription so what happens if the video transcoding cost go very high then the overall you know our essential package starts from 3 and half th000 so only transcod only will fill it up with that cost if you run through Amazon or uh you know Google trans we had estimated it cost us around 1.5 CR for all our video to move to Amazon oh man that's but one good thing is that it's not just we are consuming the open source packages we and our entire team we contribute a lot in those open source packages we have added a lot of modules and react native some of the packages we have Rewritten entirely and pushed the whole like it's a completely new package we could have launched our own open source library and something but those developers has done good job so it's our contribution it should be there yes so react native major problem we face is the react native upgrades very quickly means the source package but the plugins that we use they don't update so many times we have you know upgraded the package and contributed back to the community so new new package new new versions react versions react native versions uh there is lot of plugins that the it doesn't work so we have bu build a page on the learnist about our contribution in the open source and should have a podcast now that I have brought you here we have the discussion and idea so I think uh one page should be there that our contribution a lot of people don't know that how much we actually contribute in open source there should be a page it's all of our team that they are doing it and we are very proud of our team they are actually contributing along with their day job uh it's the part of the day job that you have to contribute in the open source so I think we should shout it out more more marketing }
